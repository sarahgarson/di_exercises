# Using the code above, implement the relevant methods and dunder methods which will output the results below.
# Hint : When adding 2 currencies which donâ€™t share the same label you should raise an error.


c1 = Currency('dollar', 5)
c2 = Currency('dollar', 10)
c3 = Currency('shekel', 1)
c4 = Currency('shekel', 10)

print(c1) 
print(int(c1)) 
print(repr(c1)) 
print(str(c1))
print(c1 + 5) 
print(c1 + c2)
# print(c1 + c3) got an error


# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Import
# Instructions
# In a file named func.py create a function that sum 2 numbers, and prints the result
# In a file named exercise_one.py import the function and call it to print the result

# (done)

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String module
# Instructions
# Generate random String of length 5
# Note: String must be the combination of the UPPER case and lower case letters only. No numbers and a special symbol.
# Hint: use the string module

import string

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Current Date
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the current date.
# Hint : Use the datetime module.

from datetime import datetime

def current_date():
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

print(current_date())


# Exercise 5 : Amount of time left until January 1st
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.
# (Example: the 1st of January is in 10 days and 10:34:01hours).

from datetime import datetime

# Exercise 6 : Birthday and minutes
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a birthdate as an argument (in the format of your choice), then displays a message stating how many minutes the user lived in his life.

from datetime import datetime

def minutes_lived(birthdate):
    birthdate = datetime.strptime(birthdate, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Exercise 7 : Faker Module
# Instructions
# Install the faker module, and take a look at the documentation and learn how to properly implement faker in your code.
# Create an empty list called users. Tip: It should be a list of dictionaries.
# Create a function that adds new dictionaries to the users list. Each user has the following keys: name, adress, langage_code. Use faker to populate them with fake data.

from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

users = []

def add_user():
    users.append({
        "name": fake.name(),
        "address": fake.address(),
        "language_code": fake.language_code()
    })
