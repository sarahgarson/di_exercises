The stranger walked into town one sunny morning. Nobody knew his name or where he came from. He carried an old leather bag and wore a mysterious smile. The townspeople watched him with curiosity as he made his way to the local cafe. The cafe owner served him coffee, and the stranger sat there for hours, writing in his notebook. Some say he was a writer, others thought he might be a traveler collecting stories. The stranger stayed in town for three days, then disappeared as mysteriously as he had arrived. The townspeople still talk about the stranger and his leather bag, wondering what secrets he carried with him.
