# Instructions
# First Download this text file

# Create a new file called anagram_checker.py which contains a class called AnagramChecker.

# The class should have the following methods:
# __init__ - should load the word list file (text file) into a variable, so that it can be searched later on in the code.
# is_valid_word(word) – should check if the given word (ie. the word of the user) is a valid word.

# get_anagrams(word) – should find all anagrams for the given word. (eg. if word of the user is ‘meat’, the function should return a list containing [“mate”, “tame”, “team”].)

# Hint: you might want to create a separate method called is_anagram(word1, word2), that will compare 2 words and return True if they contain the same letters (but not in the same order), and False if not.

# Note: None of the methods in the class should print anything.

class AnagramChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.words = self.get_words_from_file()
    
    def get_words_from_file(self):
        file_path = "/Users/sarahgarson/Documents/di_exercises/week28/Day4/ExercisesXP/words.txt"
        with open(file_path, "r") as file:
            return file.read().splitlines()
    
    def is_valid_word(self, word):
        return word in self.words
    
    def is_anagram(self, word1, word2):
        return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)
    
    def get_anagrams(self, word):
        return [w for w in self.words if self.is_anagram(word, w) and w != word]
    


# Now create another Python file, called anagrams.py. This will contain all the UI (user interface) functionality of your program, and will rely on AnagramChecker for the anagram-related logic.

# It should do the following:
# Show a menu, offering the user to input a word or exit. Keep showing the menu until the user chooses to exit.

# If the user chooses to input a word, it must be accepted from the user’s keyboard input, and then be validated:
# Only a single word is allowed. If the user typed more than one word, show an error message. (Hint: how do we know how many words were typed?)
# Only alphabetic characters are allowed. No numbers or special characters.
# Whitespace should be removed from the start and end of the user’s input.

# Once your code has decided that the user’s input is valid, it should find out the following:
# All possible anagrams to the user’s word.
# Create an AnagramChecker instance and apply it to the steps created above.
# Display the information about the word in a user-friendly, nicely-formatted message such as:


# YOUR WORD :”MEAT”
# this is a valid English word.
# Anagrams for your word: mate, tame, team.
