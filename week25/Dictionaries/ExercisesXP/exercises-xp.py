# 🌟 Exercise 1 : Convert lists into dictionaries
# Instructions
# Convert the two following lists, into dictionaries.
# Hint: Use the zip method
# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]

from turtle import home

# 🌟 Exercise 2 : Cinemax #2
# Instructions
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

# Given the following object:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# Print out the family’s total cost for the movies.
# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}

# 🌟 Exercise 3: Zara
# Instructions
# Here is some information about a brand.
# name: Zara 
# creation_date: 1975 
# creator_name: Amancio Ortega Gaona 
# type_of_clothes: men, women, children, home 
# international_competitors: Gap, H&M, Benetton 
# number_stores: 7000 
# major_color: 
#     France: blue, 
#     Spain: red, 
#     US: pink, green


# 2. Create a dictionary called brand which value is the information from part one (turn the info into keys and values).
# The values type_of_clothes and international_competitors should be a list. The value of major_color should be a dictionary.

brand = {
    'name': 'Zara',

        'France': 'blue',
        'Spain': 'red',
        'US': ['pink', 'green']
    }
}


# 3. Change the number of stores to 2.
brand['number_stores'] = 2
# 4. Print a sentence that explains who Zaras clients are.
print('Zara clients are stylish')

# 5. Add a key called country_creation with a value of Spain.
brand['country_creation'] = 'Spain'
# 6. Check if the key international_competitors is in the dictionary. If it is, add the store Desigual.
if 'international_competitors' in brand:

# 7. Delete the information about the date of creation.
brand.pop('creation_date')

# 8. Print the last international competitor.
print(brand['international_competitors'][-1])

# 9. Print the major clothes colors in the US.
print(brand['major_color']['US'])

# 10. Print the amount of key value pairs (ie. length of the dictionary).
print(len(brand))
# 11. Print the keys of the dictionary.
print(brand.keys())
# 12. Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with the following details:

# creation_date: 1975 
# number_stores: 10 000

more_on_zara = {
    'creation_date': 1975,
    'number_stores': 10000
}




# 13. Use a method to add the information from the dictionary more_on_zara to the dictionary brand.
brand.update(more_on_zara)

# 14. Print the value of the key number_stores. What just happened ?
print(brand['number_stores'])
# The value of the key number_stores is now 10000 because the update method updated the value of the key number_stores to 10000.



# Exercise 4 : Disney characters

# >>> print(disney_users_C)
