def random_number(number):
  random_number = int((number * 73) % 100 + 1)

    print("Success")
  else:
    print(f"Fail, the number was {random_number}")

random_number(50)

    for magician in magician_names:
        print(magician)

def make_great(magician_names):
    for i in range(len(magician_names)):
        magician_names[i] = magician_names[i] + " the Great"
